# 1. Taylor Series
Write a program to find an array of N consecutive values of the function y [i] = sin (2 * PI * i / N) (i = 0,1,2 ... N-1) using Taylor series. The user sets the values of N and the number n of members of the Taylor series. Taylor starts a separate process. Each pid process and the calculated value of the series. The host process reads from the value of the values of all calculated members of the Taylor series, sums them up and writes the obtained value y [i] to a file.

# 2. Event architect for Windows applications, message handling mechanism, window redrawing mechanism. (L1_5Sem)
- Develop a program that allows you to move a sprite (colored rectangle or ellipse) inside the working area of the window using the keyboard and mouse.
- Make the mouse wheel work. Scrolling moves the sprite vertically. With the Shift key held down, scrolling the wheel moves the sprite horizontally.
- Replace the sprite with a picture with a non-rectangular border.
- Give the sprite a movement with a bounce from the borders of the window.
