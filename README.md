# 1. The Taylor Series
Write a program to find an array of N consecutive values of the function y [i] = sin (2 * PI * i / N) (i = 0,1,2 ... N-1) using Taylor series. The user sets the values of N and the number n of members of the Taylor series. Taylor starts a separate process. Each pid process and the calculated value of the series. The host process reads from the value of the values of all calculated members of the Taylor series, sums them up and writes the obtained value y [i] to a file.
